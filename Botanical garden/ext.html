        <h2>Cooksonia</h2>
        <p>Cooksonia—the earliest known vascular plant, meaning it contains tissues that conduct water, sap, and nutrients—dates back to<br>
          approximately 425 million years ago. Like other early plants to evolve out of green algae, Cooksonia lacked leaves. How it photosynthesized<br>
          the sun's energy is still the subject of scientific debate.<br><br>
          Cooksonia's stems are what makes it revolutionary. With water-conducting stems, Cooksonia no longer needed to remain submerged<br>
          in water. It could colonize dry land and pave the way for animals to later emerge from the sea.</p>

          <h2>Sigillaria</h2>
          <p>Sigillaria is one of the most common types of plants from which fossil fuels are made. Looking like Joshua trees or something from a Dr.<br>
            Seuss book, Sigillaria flourished during the Carboniferous (or coal-bearing) Period of 300 to 360 million years ago.<br><br>
            The tree-like plants rose above the floor of peat-forming swamps, reproducing by spores contained in cones at the ends of their branches.<br>
            Their fossils have been uncovered during coal mining operations all across the world, from western Pennsylvania to Inner Mongolia.</p>

            <h2>Calamites</h2>
            <p>Calamites have been extinct since the Permian era some 250 million years ago, but fellow members of the horsetail genus (Equisteum) still<br>
              grow in the world's swamps. Like modern horsetails, Calamites grew in thickets from rhizomes creeping underground, sending up hollow,<br>
              ribbed, bamboo-like trunks that grew to 100-160 feet (30-50m).<br><br>
              Flourishing during the Carboniferous Period, when Earth's landmasses were all connected as Pangaea, Calamite fossils can be<br>
              found on all the continents.</p>

              <h2>Glossopteris</h2>
              <p>Glossopteris is one of the few success stories of the ill-fated Terra Nova expedition led by Robert Falcon Scott, who froze to death on<br>
                Antarctica along with his crew. When their bodies were later discovered, the 270 million-year-old fossils they had collected were<br>
                brought back to London. Glossopteris was identified, proving that Antarctica was once attached to the other continents and covered with<br>
                plant life, confirming the theory of plate tectonics.<br><br>
                Glossopteris is an early gymnosperm, a seed-producing tree whose descendants include conifers and cycads.</p>

                <h2>Araucarioxylon arizonicum</h2>
                <p>Travel through the Petrified Forest National Park, and you might see remnants of 200 to 250 million-year-old Araucarioxylon arizonicum<br>
                  trees that thrived during the Triassic Period. Some are even preserved as petroglyphs, carved by the Indigenous people living in the area as<br>
                  long as 8,000 years ago.<br><br>
                  Today, the national park is in the Navajo and Apache counties of northeastern Arizona. Other trees of the Araucaria genus still exist<br>
                  around the world—the most famous of them perhaps being the Norfolk Island pine.</p>
