          <h2 class="featurette-heading fw-normal lh-1">Botanical gardens: a unique benefit for humans</h2>
          <p class="lead"> Botanical gardens also have an important 
              role in the preservation of species necessary for human use and well-being (Waylen, 2006, Dunn, 2017), and this role is likely to become increasingly 
              important as climate change becomes more severe (Donaldson, 2009; Primack and Miller-Rushing, 2009, Ren and Duan, 2017).

            The range of scientific activities conducted by botanical gardens often includes conservation, propagation, horticulture, seed science, taxonomy, systematics,
             genetics, biotechnology, education, restoration ecology, public education, and much more . 
            
           
             Education, promoting awareness, and capacity building, involving both the public and staff at botanical gardens, 
             are vital functions of modern botanical gardens (Blackmore et al., 2011). These functions provide unique opportunities for plant biodiversity research,
              horticulture, and conservation biology in popular public places.
              Botanical gardens devote their resources to the study and conservation of plants, as well as making the world's plant species diversity known to the public. These gardens also play a central role in meeting human needs and providing well-being.

          <h2 class="featurette-heading fw-normal lh-1">The functions of botanical gardens</span></h2>
          <p class="lead">Botanical gardens are good locations for many branches of scientific research. Botanical gardens not only serve as taxonomic and systematic research centers (Dosmann, 2006, Stevens, 2007), but they also play an important role as valuable sources of plant ecology data collection such as phenological indication of climate change, plant physiology and plant growth tactics, and plant–animal interactions (Coates and Dixon, 2007, Gratani et al., 2008, Dawson et al., 2009, Primack and Miller-Rushing, 2009, Wang et al., 2018). For plant functional characteristics, botanical gardens can provide a large set of species to study functional trade-offs between species traits and plant performance (Herben et al., 2012). The study of bamboos at Xishuangbanna Tropical Botanical Garden in Yunnan, China by Cao et al. (2012) revealed that the maximum height of grasses is determined by their roots. Another example is the monitoring of plant phenology varieties, which has a long tradition in some gardens and is regarded as one of the most sensitive indicators of climate impacts on vegetation in mid-latitude areas (Menzel et al., 2006). In fact, botanical gardens have contributed greatly to our understanding of the responses of plant species to global climate change (Primack and Miller-Rushing, 2009).</p>

          <p class="lead">The Red Cross was founded in August 1864. 106 years later  in  1970,  an  engineer  named  McTaggart  launched  another  international  organization:  “The  Green  Peace  Organization”  in  Canada,  as  an  advocate  to  save  green  plants.  The  significance  and  urgency  of  green  education  have gained increased recognition by the public, and have become  an  indispensible  part  of  school  curriculum  for  children and teenagers since the 21st century. This course will be more and more important in the future. As a result, botanical  gardens  are  facing  great  challenges  and  tests.  Everything  concerning  botanical  education  including  the  direction,  content,  quality,  degree  of  public  acceptance,  scale,  style,  scientific  value,  and  interest,  should  be  tested  through practice by people. Generally speaking, education in botanical gardens focuses on environmental education, which  starts  with  knowledge  of  plants  and  botany,  then  probes  deeply  into  the  relationship  between  humans  and  nature,  as  well  as  broader  and  more  in-depth  integrated  science  fields.  Exerting  a  subtle  influence  to  improve  the  people’s  quality  is  the  general  goal  of  botanical  education  in the next few decades. </p>
